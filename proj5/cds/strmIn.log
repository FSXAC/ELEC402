WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /ubc/ece/home/ugrads/p/p5h0b/elec402/ELEC402_projects/proj5/cds/../PnR/in/gsclib045.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the refliblist file, /ubc/ece/home/ugrads/p/p5h0b/elec402/ELEC402_projects/proj5/cds/.cadence/xstream/IN/reflib.list
INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
